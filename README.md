## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Subbalakshmi Narayan Prasad, a Data Scientist and Software Engineer passionate about building AI-driven solutions. I specialize in machine learning, natural language processing, and generative AI, with a focus on Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). I'm particularly interested in AI Agents, exploring how they can autonomously perform tasks and enhance decision making in various industries.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on integrating AI Agents with LLMs to develop autonomous systems that can perform complex tasks independently.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about advanced NLP techniques, including transformer architectures and multimodal processing, to enhance AI Agent capabilities.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve applying AI Agents in real world scenarios, such as automating business processes or enhancing customer service with conversational AI.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with optimizing AI Agent workflows and improving their decision making capabilities using large language models.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about implementing AI Agents for task automation, NLP for text classification, or using AWS for scalable AI deployments.
